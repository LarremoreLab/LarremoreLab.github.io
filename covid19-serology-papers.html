Symptom cough seems to be aligned with viral shedding in clinical respiratory and fecal specimens. Stronger antibody response was associated with delayed viral clearance and disease severity..</li><li style="list-style-image:url('assets/images/covid/li_peer.png')"><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2008457?query=recirc_top_ribbon_article_3">Presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infections and Transmission in a Skilled Nursing Facility</a><br>Rapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated in this skilled nursing facility. More than half of residents with positive test results were asymptomatic at the time of testing and most likely contributed to transmission. Infection-control strategies focused solely on symptomatic residents were not sufficient to prevent transmission after SARS-CoV-2 introduction into this facility..</li></ul><h4>Discussions</h4>
