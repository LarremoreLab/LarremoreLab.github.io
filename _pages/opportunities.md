## Postdocs 

I'm always interested in learning about talented scientists. Send me an email with your CV and interests. Strong skills in applied mathematics, computer science, data science, modeling, and infectious diseases are especially of interest!

## PhD Students

It never hurts to send an email with your CV and interests! Even if I'm not looking for students, my colleagues here and elsewhere often are.

## Master's Students

I'll be on leave for Fall 2023, but, as above, it never hurts to send an email. 

## Undergraduate Students

I'll be on leave for Fall 2023, but, as above, it never hurts to send an email.
