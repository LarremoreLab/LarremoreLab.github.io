    description: Inspired in part by a study of university parental leave policies by Antecol et al. (New York Times, Inside HigherEd), we collected the paid parental leave policies for tenure-track faculty at 205 research universities in the US and Canada. The purpose of this post is to share the data we collected, highlight the complexity of many such policies, and share some preliminary analyses. Thanks to a tip from Laura Noren, we then obtained a dataset of paid parental leave policies for roughly 100 tech companies, crowdsourced by tech employees and community members after being started by Aaron Harnly of Amplify.
