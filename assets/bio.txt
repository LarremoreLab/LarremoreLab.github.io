Daniel Larremore is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and the BioFrontiers Institute, and an affiliate of the Department of Applied Mathematics, at the University of Colorado  Boulder. His research develops statistical and inferential methods for analyzing large-scale network data, and uses those methods to solve applied problems in diverse domains, including public health and academic labor markets. In particular, his work focuses on generative models for networks, the ongoing evolution and genetic epidemiology of the malaria parasite,  and the origins of social inequalities in academic hiring and careers.  Prior to joining the University of Colorado faculty, he was an Omidyar Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute 2015-2017 and a post-doctoral fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics 2012-2015.
